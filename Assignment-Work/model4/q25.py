# • What is Instantiation in terms of OOP terminology?





# Instantiation is the process of creating an object from a class.

# In OOP, a class is like a blueprint or template.

# An object is a real instance of that class in memory.

# Instantiation is what turns the blueprint (class) into an actual object you can use in your program.
